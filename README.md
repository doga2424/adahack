# **Pocket Planner**
### **A Student Budget Simulation Game**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
Pocket Planner is a **Python-based financial simulation game** designed to help university students develop better spending habits. Players navigate real-life financial decisions such as paying rent, buying groceries, going out, and handling impulsive spending—all while managing their student account and savings.

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Simulates a Month as a Student** – Players start with a fixed budget and make daily financial decisions.
- **Randomized Scenarios** – The game presents real-world spending situations, including eating out, rent payments, and unexpected expenses.
- **Savings & Overdraft Management** – Players can transfer funds between a student account and a savings account to avoid bankruptcy.
- **Game Progression** – At the start of each month, players receive additional funds to continue managing their finances.
- **Win/Loss Conditions** – The goal is to **stay financially responsible** and **avoid going bankrupt**.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Python** – Core programming language for game logic.
- **Tkinter** – (Planned for UI, not currently implemented).
- **Random Module** – Used to generate financial scenarios and spending behavior.
- **Time Module** – Simulates real-time delays for an interactive experience.

## 🔧 **How to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pocket-planner.git
   cd pocket-planner
   ```
2. **Run the Game**
   ```
   python pocketPlanner.py
   ```
3. **Follow the on-screen prompts** to make financial decisions.

## 📖 **How It Works**
1. Players start with **£840 in their student account**.
2. **Fixed expenses (e.g., rent) are automatically deducted**.
3. Random financial choices appear, requiring players to decide whether to spend money or save.
4. Players can deposit into or withdraw from their **savings account** when funds are low.
5. The game runs until:
   - The player **completes a month responsibly** 🎉.
   - The **student account balance goes below -£30 (bankruptcy)** ❌.

## 🏆 **Why This Project?**
Pocket Planner was developed to **encourage financial literacy among students** by simulating common spending habits in a fun, interactive way. It balances **practical decision-making** with an engaging, randomized gameplay experience.
